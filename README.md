## ‚ú® Features

-   **Categorized Problem List:** The extensive list of over 10,000 DSA problems is neatly organized by topics and subtopics for easy navigation.
-   **Local Progress Tracking:** Mark problems as `Not Started`, `In Progress`, `Solved`, or `Review` using a simple dropdown menu. All progress is saved automatically to your browser's local storage.
-   **Personal Notes:** Each problem includes a dedicated notes section where you can write down your logic, complex ideas, or code snippets. These notes are also saved automatically.
-   **Dynamic Search & Filter:** Quickly find problems by searching for keywords or filter the list to view problems by their status (e.g., only show `Review` or `Unsolved` problems).
-   **Accordion Interface:** Subtopics are organized into collapsible sections, keeping the interface clean and focused.
-   **Data Management:** Easily export your entire progress and notes as a JSON file for backup. You can also import a previously saved JSON file to restore your progress on a new device or browser.
